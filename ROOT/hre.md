# States of the Holy Roman Empire: Quick Reference

This page summarizes the three main categories of Imperial Estates (Reichsstände)—the political communities that
were immediate (reichsunmittelbar) to the Emperor and held a seat and vote in the Imperial Diet (Reichstag).

The Imperial Estates fall into three buckets: Secular principalities, Ecclesiastical principalities, and Imperial
(Free) Cities. Together they composed the Diet; immediate groups without a seat (e.g., Imperial Knights) are not
counted among the Estates.

## What isn’t counted as a “State of the Empire”

Imperial Knights (Reichsritter): Immediate nobles with tiny lordships but no seat in the Diet.

Imperial Villages: A handful of immediate rural communes; no seat in the Diet.

Mediatized or subject territories: Lordships subordinated to an Estate (i.e., not immediate) are not Estates.
